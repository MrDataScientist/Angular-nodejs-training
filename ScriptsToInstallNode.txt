Script to install node on a Linux Box
Source : https://bizsitegenie.com/script-to-install-node-on-a-linux-box/

The below list of commands can be put in a .sh file and run on the virtual box to install node:

cd /opt
sudo wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.2/node-v0.12.2.tar.gz
sudo tar zxf node-v0.12.2.tar.gz
cd node-v0.12.2
sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
sudo make
sudo make install
node -v

Make sure the sh file has execute permissions before you attempt to run it. Do a ls -l to see the file permissions. Use the chmod command to change the permission.

I created this script for the latest version of node at the time of this writing. Change the version in the file name to install a different version. Go to nodejs.org to check the latest version that is available to download:
